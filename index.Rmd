## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to some aspect of global health. I am taking a class on global health, and it is discussing a lot about the barriers to accessing healthcare and how that has been influenced by years of segregation and the history of colonization. I think it could be really interesting to do an analysis on a certain aspect of that.
